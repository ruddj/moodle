 * Upgrade helper functions

 * This file is used for special upgrade functions - for example groups and gradebook.
 * These functions must use SQL and database related functions only- no other Moodle API,
 * because it might depend on db structures that are not yet present during upgrade.
 * (Do not use functions from accesslib.php, grades classes or group functions at all!)
