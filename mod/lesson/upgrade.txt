This files describes API changes in the lesson code.

=== 2.9 ===
* The  grade_item_delete function in mod/lesson/lib.php was removed because it was not doing anything and was never called.
* A third optional boolean parameter $endreached was added to lesson::update_timer to indicate that end of lesson was reached. This is used by 'completionendreached' custom completion rule.
* lesson_page_type_endofbranch::update in mod/lesson/pagetypes/endofbranch.php
  and lesson_page_type_endofcluster::update in mod/lesson/pagetypes/endofcluster.php
  have been removed, this is now handled by the base class: lesson_page::update in
  locallib.php and the exact same code is executed (it is also executed by the
  lesson_page_type_cluster class that previously had no update function).

=== Earlier changes ===

* Were not documented in this way. Sorry.
