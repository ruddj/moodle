Feature: Content-Item support
  In order to easily add activities and content in a course from an external tool
  As a teacher
  I need to utilise a tool that supports the Content-Item Message type

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | teacher1 | Terry1    | Teacher1 | teacher1@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category |
      | Course 1 | C1 | 0 |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Manage tools" node in "Site administration > Plugins > Activity modules > External tool"
    And I follow "configure a tool manually"
    And I set the field "Tool name" to "Teaching Tool 1"
    And I set the field "Tool base URL/cartridge URL" to local url "/mod/lti/tests/fixtures/tool_provider.php"
    And I set the field "Tool configuration usage" to "Show in activity chooser and as a preconfigured tool"
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the field "Content-Item Message" to "1"
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I log out

  @javascript
  Scenario: Tool that supports Content-Item Message type should be able to configure a tool via the Select content button
    When I log in as "teacher1"
    And I follow "Course 1"
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add a "Teaching Tool 1" to section "1"
    Then the "Select content" "button" should be enabled

  @javascript
  Scenario: Adding a preconfigured tool that does not support Content-Item.
    When I log in as "teacher1"
    And I follow "Course 1"
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add a "Teaching Tool 1" to section "1"
    And the "Select content" "button" should be enabled
    And I set the field "Activity name" to "Test tool activity 1"
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the field "Launch container" to "Embed"
    And I press "Save and return to course"
    And I open "Test tool activity 1" actions menu
    And I choose "Edit settings" in the open action menu
    Then the field "Preconfigured tool" matches value "Teaching Tool 1"
    # When editing settings, the Select content button should be disabled.
    And the "Select content" "button" should be disabled

    And the field "Preconfigured tool" matches value "Automatic, based on launch URL"
    And the "Select content" "button" should be disabled
    And I set the field "Activity name" to "Test tool activity 1"
    And I set the field "Preconfigured tool" to "Teaching Tool 1"
    Then the "Select content" "button" should be enabled
